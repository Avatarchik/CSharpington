  C# Reflection, Parsing, and Script Generation Library for Unity.
  </p>

**CSharpington is being cancelled. I created it alongside a plugin I was creating for Unity. That was moved completely out of Unity into a WPF application. I can no longer justify working on this when it is nowhere close to finished. Perhaps I'll emerge with a remake that is cleaner and more complete, that has no dependencies on Unity. After all, I'll still need something like this. Hope everyone's okay with the decision. Always feel free to fork.
